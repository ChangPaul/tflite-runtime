# tflite-runtime
Compiled TensorFlow lite runtime. This interpreter-only package is a fraction the size of the full TensorFlow package and includes the bare minimum code required to run inferences with TensorFlow Liteâ€”it includes only the `tf.lite.Interpreter` Python class. This small package is ideal when all you want to do is execute `.tflite` models and avoid wasting disk space with the large TensorFlow library.
